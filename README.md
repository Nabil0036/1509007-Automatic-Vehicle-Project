Computer Vision:
=====

For computer vision OpenCV will be used. Primary concern is lane detection and lane following.

* In the 1st stage predownloaded example photo will be used for lane.
* In the 2nd stage laptop's webcam will be used for taking picture.
* At 3rd and final stage Raspberry pi and pi camera will be tried to use.
